Welcome to the documentation site for the Gabe project! This site is intended to document more technical information about the Gabe software itself.

If you want to run your own instance of Gabe, you might be looking for the [Setup](setup.md) page. If you're just looking to add the bot to your server, head over to [https://gabe.net/invite](https://gabe.net/invite).
