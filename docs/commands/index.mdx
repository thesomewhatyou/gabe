## Command Permissions

### Required Permissions

| Command      | Discord Permission Required |
| ------------ | --------------------------- |
| ban          | Ban Members                 |
| kick         | Kick Members                |
| timeout      | Moderate Members            |
| untimeout    | Moderate Members            |
| purge        | Manage Messages             |
| _All others_ | No special permissions      |

### Safety Features

Gabe includes several safety features for moderation commands:

1. **Permission Checks** — Users must have the required Discord permission
2. **Role Hierarchy** — Cannot moderate users with Administrator or same-level moderation permissions
3. **Self-Protection** — Cannot target yourself or Gabe
4. **Owner Override** — Bot owner (set in `.env`) can bypass permission checks

**Example Safety Messages:**

- "I'm not banning a mod/admin. That's above my pay grade."
- "You can't kick yourself! Just leave if you want out."
- "I'm not timing myself out. That's counterproductive!"
