# Runtime Compatibility

Gabe targets the Node.js runtime but also runs on Deno and Bun. This page describes version requirements, behavioural differences, and known quirks when you choose an alternative runtime.

:::warning
Bun and Deno support is best-effort. If you hit bugs, verify whether they reproduce on Node.js first. When filing an issue, note the runtime (`bun --version` or `deno --version`) that exhibited the problem.
:::

## Setup

Minimum supported versions:

- Node.js: **22.0.0**
- Bun: **1.1**
- Deno: **2.3**

Follow the standard [setup guide](../setup/) regardless of runtime. Use the matching launch command afterward:

- Node.js: `pnpm start`
- Bun: `pnpm start:bun`
- Deno: `pnpm start:deno`

When building for Bun or Deno you can swap `pnpm build` with `pnpm build:natives`—both runtimes can execute TypeScript without transpiling.

## Differences

Gabe enables runtime-specific tweaks to improve parity and performance.

Shared changes (Bun + Deno):

- The `stats` command reports the runtime version in use (e.g., `bun 1.1.x`).

Bun-specific changes:

- SQLite driver switches to `bun:sqlite` instead of `better-sqlite3`.

Deno-specific changes:

- SQLite driver uses `@db/sqlite` from [JSR](https://jsr.io/@db/sqlite).
- Database plugins load with a `.ts` extension.

## Known Issues

- Native modules (e.g., `better-sqlite3`, image bindings) may crash during startup on Bun or Deno. For Deno, switch Node.js to v22 and run `pnpm rebuild`. For Bun, use Node.js v24 before running the same command.
