# Deployment 1

11/5/25 deployment was a success.

Added uptime, info, etc

Made some fixes. Added a ghcr deployment workflow (we now have a container so people can pull from it).

Shards all up and 3 clusters with Gabe on it (Dev cluster, beta cluster, prod) all operate fine

This repo runs from dev cluster and such but dev clusters do not carry risks as they're usually tested. Beta cluster is barely used, only with big deployments

Prod cluster is up. 

Goodbye
