# Gabe - Your Discord Bro (or Enemy)                                                                                                 		 

**gabe** is a Discord bot that's equipped with POWER, personality, and hell. Built with [Oceanic](https://oceanic.ws), it's strong and works well. 

## What Makes Gabe Special

- **Powerful Image Processing** - Turn your memes into masterpieces (or disasters) with [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips) (Sorry, no memory optimization here).
- **Moderation Tools** - Ban, kick, timeout, and ENTER THE PURGE
- **Music Playback** - Just chill with [Lavalink](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink) (It's gonna be a thing you host seperately, though).                
- **Server Tags** - Save and retrieve your favorite stuff
- **Performance** - Low RAM and CPU utilization (**gabe** takes naps). If it looks low, that's normal.  <img src="./docs/assets/me.jpg?raw=true" align="right" width="128" height="176">
- **Dual Command Support** - Slash commands AND prefix-based commands
- **Database Flexibility** - PostgreSQL and SQLite support (SQLite is preferred, but Postgre works)
- **Easy to Extend** - Add new commands by just dropping in script files
- **Personality** - run

Gabe does not respond to commands via regular text forms. They can be done with commands, however. Sorry.
